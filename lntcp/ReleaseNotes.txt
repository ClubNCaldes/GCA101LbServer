Version 1.90
 * MAC address changed to 0x00.0x4D.0x56.0x31.0x30.0x31
 * Window size decreased.
 * Number of connections reduced to 1.   
 * If no data to be transmitted when polled by uip skip all. 
 * ENC28J60 added some checks when transmitting data. 

Version 1.89
 * Corrected IP offset values.   
 
Version 1.88
 * If all jumpers are set IP settings are read from EEPROM. 
 * Restored flashing of led if a Loconet message is received from the Loconet bus. 

Version 1.87
 * Loconet buffer size set to 250, after update version 1.78 it was not put back.
 * uIP update time to 14 msec. 

Version 1.86
 * uIP stack update timer interrupt driven.
 * uIP stack update set to 12 msec.

Version 1.85
 * If an ACK is received from RocRail then it's checked if data is present in the Loconet buffer.
   If data is present it's transmitted.
 * uIP stack update time set to 24 msec. Lower values cause retransmit and disrupted communications. 

Version 1.84
 * Refresh of stack every 2 msec. This is done to get the Loconet query data to the PC with RocRail.    

Version 1.83
 * Refresh of stack cycle timechanged for faster interaction. 

Version 1.82
 * TPCIP stack changed to uIP.   

Version 1.81
 * Retransmission parameter for ENC28J60 set to 10. 
 * If a Loconet message from TCPIP to Loconet bus was not transmitted successfully no ACK is
   transmitted. As a consequence RocRail will retransmit (restored change of 1.75).
 * Enabled the MAC filtering option of the ENC. Only broadcast messages and messages with the MGV101
   MAC address are accepted by the ENC28J60. This should reduce the overhead for the Atmel when non MGV101 data is received.  

Version 1.80
 * Loconet Bittime define restored... 

Version 1.79
 * ALL sources exclusing the Loconet files are put back to version 1.73.  

Version 1.78
 * Updated used Loconet to status found on http://embeddedloconet.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/embeddedloconet/ date 21-12-2010.
 * Moved LN_TIMER_TX_RELOAD_ADJUST to sysdef.h and reduced value. 
 * TcpIp receive handler if data is received use the index forwarded from the stack. 

Version 1.77
 * Loconet sources now the same as 1.73.  

Version 1.76
 * Ethernet stack some improvements. Connecting to RocRail should now work at first time. 
 * Serial logging dis- enable with define.
 * Loconet bittime decreased with 1. 
 
Version 1.75
 * Removed LoconetTxBuffer. Caused instable behaviour. 
 * Added logging by means of simple serial port logging for testing purposes.
 * If Loconet data could not be transmitted from TCPIP->Loconet NO Ack is transmitted. 
   In this case RocRail will retransmit he data not acked...  
 
Version 1.74
 * Added a Loconet Tx buffer. Data received from TCPIP is put into a Locnet intermediate transmit buffer. 
   The buffer tries to transmit the data each main loop. By this a potential blocking while loop in the
   TCPIP receive part is removed.
 * Loconet receive data processing changed. 
 * Some double actions in the code are put together in routine EthLocBufferTcpIpConnectionEnded().
 * Loconet bit time hard coded.     

Version 1.73
 * Added code so fuses don't have to be set in case a Mega168 is used out of the box. 
   If not out of the box, make sure to select 8Mhz internal clock and CLKDIV needs to be active. 
   
Version 1.72
 * Change of 1.71 slightly changed again. If long messages where received the MGV101 didn't
   do anything more. Buffer is read so the 28J60 is not put into reset. 
 * 3 Gratitiuos ARP packets are transmitted as soon as a link is discovered. By this MGV101
   announces itself to the network. 
 * If a ping command is received the Loconet indication led will flash. 
 * Padding disabled of ENC28J60.
 * After all retries to transmit data on TCPIP data failed MGV101 transmits a TCPIP message with
   the FIN flag set.
 * If the link is down for ~2 seconds and a connection to RocRail was present or if retransmit 
   maximum is reached GlobalPowerOff is transmitted on the Loconet bus. 

Version 1.71
 * If a TCP/IP packet is received larger compared to the TCP/IP receive buffer of the Atmel the
   ENC28J60 was put in reset. Changed this into reading the data out of the ENC28J60 buffer but not
   storing it.  

Version 1.7
 * Padding enabled of ENC28J60. By this network messages with a size lower 64 are filled up to 64.
 * Non used items (for example UDP) removed from stack.c 
 * ENC driver cleaned up.
 * If connection was ended by RocRail MGV101 did not see this, fixed this. After connection is ended 
   the run led and the TCPIP led will blink simultaniously.   

Version 1.6 16-10-2010
 * Jumpers can be used to select a FIXED IP address for the MGV101. 
    * No jumpers set is 192.168.0.200
    * Jumper on PC0 (JP1) is 192.168.1.200
    * Jumper on PC1 (JP2) is 192.168.100.88
    * All other combinations default to 192.168.0.200
 * If no valid IP data is received / connection not present the ethernet led (LED 5) will blink to indicate no connection.
   With connection the connection to RocRail is ment, not if MGV101 is connected to the nework. If connection is 
   present can be observed on the leds of the macjack.  
 * Added a fix, after certain message types the target mac address was incorrect. 
    
Version 1.5 14-10-2010
 * IP address set fixed to 192.168.100.88. 

Version 1.4 13-10-2010
 * UDP is replaced by TCP/IP. 
 * Used TCPIP stack is now from http://www.ulrichradig.de/home/index.php/avr/eth_m32_ex  
 * Generated hex file renamed to MGV101.hex 

Version 1.3 04-08-2010
 * ENC handling updated. The status register is examined after a message is transmitted. If transmit
   fails, it's retried to transmit the message. 
 * Sometimes messages transmitted on the ethernet bus get lost (although ENC handling was updated). 
   The ENC28J60 tells us the message was transmitted succesfully, but WireShark and RocRail received nothing. 
   This causes troubles with sensor messages. As temp work around added transmitting sensor messages twice.
 * UserIo IP routines removed / simplified. 
  
Version 1.2 21-07-2010
 * Removed ALL serial logging and serial output for user.  
 * The loconet receive buffer is increased to 600 bytes. Buffer variables for buffer changed to 16 bits for this.  
 * Non used functions removed. 
 * Added extra loop for transmitting loconet data. 

Version 1.1 13-07-2010
 * Added extra logging option using jumper 2. Loconet data and UDP data are forwarded on the serial port. 
 * The echo in the Loconet driver is removed. 

Version 1.0 28-06-2010
 * Initial version.
