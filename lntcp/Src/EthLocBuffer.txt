@section Introduction Introduction
The MGV101 EthernetLoconetBuffer is a device acting as a gateway between Loconet and the network connection 
of a PC. This eliminates the use of a serial usb converter, which sometimes gives troubles.<br> 
Now just connect the MGV101 to your PC or router, setup RocRail for MGV101 and have fun!<br>
See http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=mgv101-en&DokuWiki= for details on the MGV101 hardware.<br>

@section Software Overview. 
Routine \ref EthLocBufferMain checks if any data is present in the ethernet interface or LocoNet.<br>
Depending on the data type, ethernet data is or Loconet data is forwarded to the Loconet or Ethernet bus.<br> 
If you want to examine the software, start in \ref main. The software itself is not complicated and well documented to my opinion.
 
@section External Software Modules. 
For Loconet the Loconet driver is used from http://sourceforge.net/projects/embeddedloconet/  <br>
- The MGV101 is added as option to the driver. <br>
- Non used function are removed. 

The used Ethernet software is uIP from http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page and <br>
http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?module=Freaks%20Files&func=viewFile&id=3055&showinfo=1 
- The uip_init interface is changed so all relevant data is set at once. 
- ENC28J60 added filtering on MAC address.  

@section Building Building the code. 
- Download WINAVR version 20070122 at http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/WinAVR/20070122/ <br>
  Other versions may also be used, but tested is with the 20070122 version. 
- Open the Programmers NotePad project file MGV101.pnproj. Programmers NotePad is an installation option of WinAvr. 
- Select Tools->Make All
- Flash the generated hex file EtLocBuf.hex into the Atmel microcontroller. 

@section IpAddress IpAddress selection.
The IP address for the MGV101 is FIXED. For now 3 Ip Addresses can be selected using the jumpers. 
- No jumpers set is 192.168.0.200
- Jumper on PC0 (JP1) is 192.168.1.200
- Jumper on PC1 (JP2) is 192.168.100.88

All other combinations default to 192.168.0.200 

@section Windows Windows and TCP/Ack delay. 
The MGV101 receives an ACK message on each transmitted TCP/IP message to RocRail.<br>
If you are using Windows, you might encounter slow response of the MGV101 and RocRail.<br>
This is caused by the Ack delay in Windows. It's usefull to add the registery entry TcpAckFrquency.<br>
Below in a few words how I changed this... 

- Start->Opdrachtpromp->RegEdit
- Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->SYSTEM->CurrentControlSet->Services->TcpIp->Interfaces
- Search the applicable interface, find it by comparing the listed IP addresses with the IP address of your PC.
- Select Bewerken -> Nieuw -> DWORD
- Double click on the new entry and change the name into TcpAckFrequency and enter value 1. 
- Press OK, and restart your machine.
- Now the data exchange between RocRail and MGV101 is fast.

@section Connection Connection
Some network interfaces have an autodetection regarding the connection. If the MGV101 <br>
is not reqognized, use a cross cable or a router / switch.<br>
